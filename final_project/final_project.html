                    <h4>Idea #1: <i>Coffee x Connection</i></h4>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>I grew to be a coffee-lover in 2020 after originally hating it altogether. Today, I adore the routine of waking up and brewing a nice cup of coffee with steamed oat milk, a dash of cinnamon, and a drizzle of honey. It's been my routine throughout the summer, school semesters, and everything in-between. 
                        Something that has changed often, however, is the time of day that I would like a coffee - particularly in the morning. I change my morning alarm constantly, and it is never a pleasant experience to wake up startled and to then have to wait for that first cup of coffee! 
                        To resolve this, I would like to create a small device that I can attach to my coffee machine & generally automatic coffee makers (Keurigs, Nespressos, and more) that is connected to my phone via Wifi or Bluetooth. When my phone's alarm goes off, I would like for the device to simply start the coffee brewing after ensuring
                        that there is enough water in the tank, and that there is a mug to catch the coffee when it is ready. Despite my searching, I have yet to see a device that can provide this ability to dynamically brew your coffee automatically from your phone yet! I'd love to create it and to make it usable as an add-on to any existing coffee machines. 
                        Rather than requiring people to buy an entirely new coffee set-up, I'd like the device to be flexible enough to attach to multiple types of machines & to adapt accordingly. In addition to brewing coffee when an alarm goes off, I'd also like to make a Siri command so that I can say, "Hey Siri, make me a coffee please," and have the coffee be made.
                        I am unsure if this idea is too simple, too ambitious, or happily balanced in-between, except it has truly been on my mind for years! I'm excited to hopefully make it happen! An added bonus is that this will motivate me to avoid clicking "Snooze" on my alarm, or the coffee will become cold!

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>In a very similar topic to my first idea, I'd love to build a machine to help create beautiful latte art to put on coffees! Latte art can be accomplished
                        often through steaming a type of milk and then following intentional movements of the cup and milk in sync. Different movements can create different art designs, and I'd 
                        love to create a device that can mimic 2-3 of these designs. In order to accomplish this, the device would need to balance intentionally coded movements in addition to observing
                        properties of the coffee & milk (such as how full each are to prevent overflow and to ensure the design can be finished properly).

                    For my final project, I am hoping to create a multi-purpose home device that can activate coffee machines, start tea kettles, turn off lights, and more
                    through the ability to take on multiple ranges of motion. In particular, I am planning on focusing on the ability to start a Nespresso machine and a Keurig from 
                    a person's phone! I imagine that the final project will look a bit like a clip for a bag of chips that can be placed on the side of any coffee machine (easily installable and easily removable without any changes to the machine itself).
                    The clip will have a "pressing" motion, which will use pressure sensors to ensure that it can press a button, or turn off a light switch, with enough pressure, yet not too much pressure to cause damage. 
                    Additionally, the clip will have an Arduino that can use Wifi or Bluetooth to be called upon by a laptop or a computer to activate a certain motion.
