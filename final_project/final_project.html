                    <h4>Idea #1: <i>Coffee x Connection</i></h4>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>I grew to be a coffee-lover in 2020 after originally hating it altogether. Today, I adore the routine of waking up and brewing a nice cup of coffee with steamed oat milk, a dash of cinnamon, and a drizzle of honey. It's been my routine throughout the summer, school semesters, and everything in-between. 
                        Something that has changed often, however, is the time of day that I would like a coffee - particularly in the morning. I change my morning alarm constantly, and it is never a pleasant experience to wake up startled and to then have to wait for that first cup of coffee! 
                        To resolve this, I would like to create a small device that I can attach to my coffee machine & generally automatic coffee makers (Keurigs, Nespressos, and more) that is connected to my phone via Wifi or Bluetooth. When my phone's alarm goes off, I would like for the device to simply start the coffee brewing after ensuring
                        that there is enough water in the tank, and that there is a mug to catch the coffee when it is ready. Despite my searching, I have yet to see a device that can provide this ability to dynamically brew your coffee automatically from your phone yet! I'd love to create it and to make it usable as an add-on to any existing coffee machines. 
                        Rather than requiring people to buy an entirely new coffee set-up, I'd like the device to be flexible enough to attach to multiple types of machines & to adapt accordingly. In addition to brewing coffee when an alarm goes off, I'd also like to make a Siri command so that I can say, "Hey Siri, make me a coffee please," and have the coffee be made.
                        I am unsure if this idea is too simple, too ambitious, or happily balanced in-between, except it has truly been on my mind for years! I'm excited to hopefully make it happen! An added bonus is that this will motivate me to avoid clicking "Snooze" on my alarm, or the coffee will become cold!

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>In a very similar topic to my first idea, I'd love to build a machine to help create beautiful latte art to put on coffees! Latte art can be accomplished
                        often through steaming a type of milk and then following intentional movements of the cup and milk in sync. Different movements can create different art designs, and I'd 
                        love to create a device that can mimic 2-3 of these designs. In order to accomplish this, the device would need to balance intentionally coded movements in addition to observing
                        properties of the coffee & milk (such as how full each are to prevent overflow and to ensure the design can be finished properly).

                    <h4>Approach & MVP Goals</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>
                       For my minimum viable product, I had a couple of goals set for myself. First, I will describe what I hoped to create,
                       and then how I approached the building of the MVP.
                        <br><br>
                        First, I decided that I would approach my idea for a Wifi/Bluetooth-enabled machine that could brew your coffee
                        on demand from your phone or scheduled in advance. The name is likely also an MVP (I can find a better one) - CoffeeClip.
                        The idea for the final version is that this coffee clip can be attached to any common machine, so that you don't have to spend 
                        a fortune buying a specific machine to have these capabilities. Instead, the coffee clip will be able to adapt height-wise and width-wise to attach
                        to Keurigs, Nespressos, or even tea kettles. 
                        <br><br>
                        For my MVP, I decided that I would try to create the CoffeeClip for one machine and to create the behind-the-scenes software that allows it to 
                        run. By focusing on one machine, I can see what technical details are involved, which I hope will then make expanding out to be more flexible
                        a bit easier (as I will know what challenges I might encounter).
                        <br><br>
                        In order to work on the MVP, I needed a place to get started, so I broke down my MVP into a few different objectives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Connect the ESP32 to Wifi or Bluetooth (Decide which is better)</li>
                            <li>Determine the best way to connect a website & an iPhone app to the ESP32</li>
                            <li>Code the software that enables communication between users and the ESP32</li>
                            <li>Identify the best motor to accomplish the "pressing button" action</li>
                            <li>Build a holder and an arm for the motor</li>
                            <li>Design a way to attach the motor, holder, and arm to my Nespresso machine</li>
                            <li>Connect the hardware to the software!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        Since I knew that I wouldn't be able to easily build the hardware while at home for Spring Break,
                        I instead focused primarily on the software. I believed that this would be the more time-consuming and challenging part of
                        my MVP since my work in software has never interacted with hardware in this way before. I started by talking with the course teaching staff
                        and looking into the benefits and downsides of Wifi vs. Bluetooth. My goal is that I could be able to start brewing a coffee at home 
                        while I am walking back from class (where I am not in Bluetooth range), yet I also wanted to make sure that the device doesn't necessarily need to be
                        on the same Wifi as my phone in order to work. In particular, I didn't want to switch from Harvard Secure to Harvard University Wifi only 
                        to be able to activate my coffee machine! I need to do this with some of my devices and it is tedious and not a great user experience.
                        After considering options, I determined that I would use Wifi to power my device, and I would connect the ESP32 to a Google Firebase 
                        Realtime database which can be accessed via the Wifi. If all communication between the device and the database, then 
                        my phone or laptop can connect to the database from anywhere over Wifi as well. This means that I can be out-of-range and on different Wifi,
                        which I hope will make a better experience. As a benefit, this also streamlines the communication process. 
                        <br><br>
                        What does the communication process look like for the ESP32? The ESP32 has a connection with the Firebase Realtime Database and loops over a request to 
                        check for changes to the database. If the ESP32 detects a change to the database, then, using a custom class CoffeeClip, it will parse the change 
                        and respond accordingly. If the change indicates that the user would like to request a coffee on demand, then the database would update to show a 
                        pending request for a coffee. The ESP32 can detect the pending request and proceed to brew the coffee, updating the database to mark the request 
                        as completed with a timestamp of completion as a final step. This is quite convenient to do given that the ESP32 is constantly looping, which makes 
                        monitoring the database for changes quite nice to do!

                        <br><br>
                        How does a device communicate with the database? I knew that I wanted to be able to run the coffee machine from either my laptop or my phone. 
                        A few ambitious ideas that I have are to connect my google calendar to my coffee machine to brew coffees in between events when I have denoted that I am going home in-between (this is a stretch goal)!
                        Thus, I wanted to be able to host both a website and iOS application. For my MVP, I decided to focus on a website that connects to Firebase and has a simple interface 
                        so that I can request a coffee on demand or schedule a coffee to be made at a given time. The website for the MVP will not have design elements, but will focus
                        purely on a functionality perspective. I also worked on (and am continuing to work on) creating an iOS application which can control the same components.

                        <br>
                        I started working on the software to make this all happen over Spring Break, starting with the Arduino code since I knew that I was more unfamiliar with it.
                        I utilized the Firebase ESP32 Client and Wifi packages to aid in communicating with the database. I used Firebase via Google since I knew it is free and has 
                        great documentation. I then created two classes, one called DatabaseManager which manages monitoring the database and making writes to it when necessary. 
                        I also made a class called CoffeeClip that would separately manage the eventual movement of the servo and balancing the results from the database with 
                        the necessary physical actions. I worked on these two classes separately so that I could learn a bit more about both along the way. I am still working on 
                        combining these two files and functionalities, however.

                    <p>
                        When I returned from Spring Break, I began working on the hardware. Originally, I pictures the pressing mechanism to be on the countertop with
                        coffee machine that would extend up. However, while I was working, it was very unstable. I then scrapped my original models and started over. 
                        I decided that the mechanism could hold onto the coffee machine horizontally, instead of both vertically and horizontally. I then built a servo holder,
                        which took a TON of time. I also needed to make a Servo holder, which I did from scratch in Fusion. While printing the arm of the Servo, I started 
                        to notice the imperfections of 3D printing, where it kept being ever-so-slightly too small, but I did not want to make over-corrections. I ended up 
                        reprinting multiple times, and I still need to refine the dimensions.
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        After building this original setup, I realized something devastating - the servo arm does not have enough strength 
                        to click the button on the machine. I needed to find a way to increase the torque by adding gears that then have 
                        the power to push the button. Thus, I started modeling gears in Fusion and attempting to connect them to the servo.
                        Originally, I planned on screwing in the smaller gear into the Servo and then attaching the larger gear beside it to 
                        hold the arm. I printed these and after many attempts, I was able to get each part to fit properly!

                        It was at this point that I realized another devastating mistake that I had make. It did not cross my mind 
                        that by screwing the gears into the arm and the Servo that it could slip or might not turn successfully. I realized 
                        that I needed to fit the gear around the Servo instead, and that the arm would need to be directly attached. 
                        In order to get the gear to fit around the Servo, I would need to be incredibly precise, or I would face the same issue.
                        I had substantive doubt around whether or not the 3D printer could achieve the level of precision needed to fit around the servo with 
                        the shape that could hold onto it properly, yet I had amazing luck that it worked on the first try!
                        <br><br>
                        <u>As of now, I still need to attach the arm to the larger gear and to refine the way that the hardware 
                            is attached to the Nespresso, but I hope that through these learning experiences and the connection of the software
                            to hardware that this is a viable MVP. Thank you!

                        This week I focused on thinking about how I could hide the wires & ESP32 from public eye, while 
                        still allowing the servo to be connected easily. I primarily focused on talking to the teaching staff this week about the best way to 
                        power both the Servo and ESP32. At first, I was pretty certain that I would use batteries since I have a limited number of outlets near 
                        where I keep my coffee machine. However, after many conversations with classmates, the idea of having to buy batteries, keep them charged (or waste them), and generally 
                        think about the batteries would be a huge burden long-term. I can also buy an extension cord with extra plugs to alleviate my other problem. Thus, I decided to use a 5V power supply that plugs 
                        into the wall to power both the ESP32 and the Servo. I also decided that I would create a box for these components right next to the Servo, although separated, on top of my coffee machine. While I originally wanted to 
                        hide these components on the side or bottom of the machine, I decided that I could use this added space on top of the machine to add a coffee-bar sign or to place things like cinnamon & honey. Rather than serving no aesthetic purpose, 
                        I could make this into a part of the visual design! I designed a "coffee on tap" sign in Fusion to add onto the holder. Here are some images, and feel free to download the Fusion files below:
