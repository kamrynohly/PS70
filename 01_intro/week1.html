                       While creating this website, I started from scratch and drew a lot of inspiration from the Bootstrap framework. I've always loved
                       website design & creation, and so I look forward to adding more creativity & fun to this site over the course of the semester. For now,
                       I've primarily used HTML & CSS to build the framing of the site & starting designs. I hope to incorporate some JS features, such as animations
                       and making the site more dynamic over the next few days & weeks. 
                       <br><br>
                       I started by creating the home page to highlight the weeks of the course. I used Bootstrap's "Cards" layout to assist in making these
                       appear a bit more pretty in terms of formatting. I customized the Bootstrap code to be sure the designs were more aligned with my taste, and I also 
                       added the buttons to the cards to permit users of the site to navigate more easily.
                       <br><br>
                       Next, I built the "About" page. This uses basic HTML & CSS, yet I also wanted to introduce videos & images into the site to make it a bit more fun!
                       This included embedding two videos from Youtube that I truly enjoy (one for fun & one about my hometown)!
                       <br><br>
                       Lastly, the site detailing my final project proposals was kept quite simple, as I hope to continue building it up as the ideas become more concrete and as I 
                       receive more feedback.
