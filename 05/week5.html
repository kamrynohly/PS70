                        This week I was super excited to imagine a few exciting objects that I could model and print! Initially,
                        I was hoping to make one or more of the following for my 3D Design & Print:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A miniature Eiffel Tower on a keychain that could clip onto my backpack</li>
                            <li>A flower that could turn in circles with a little twisting wheel</li>
                            <li>Trying to print a version of my hometown's geography</li>
                        </ul>
                        However, unsurprisingly, these proved to be very hard. Thus, while this page has what I've currently made so far, I will absolutely
                        be returning to this week to make major improvements.

                        This week, I tried to scan using photogrammetry applications available on my phone. In particular, I tried downloading many different "free" applications, mostly to be met 
                        with the need to pay to scan or to pay to receive the download of the results. I typically deleted this quite clickly, and if I did use them, I usually didn't get great results.
                        I ended up downloading and starting a free trial with Polycam, which has a very intuitive and easy-to-learn UI, yet is very expensive after the free trial. Originally, I was going to scan 
                        the CS50 rubber duck, however, it struggled to pick up on the surfaces. Thus, I decided to try to scan a pair of sunglasses! 

                        I started by taking the minimum number of photos to see how it would behave (20 photos), and it essentially picked up on the background of sunglasses, which was very texturized. 
                        However, as you can see below, the scan of the sunglasses itself is incredibly incomplete and is unusable if not edited greatly.

                        <br>
                        When I attempted to put the 3D model into Fusion and the slicing software, it did not contain enough information or substance to be able to 3D print it. It was 
                        challenging from certain angles to even see the shape of the glasses.

                        After scanning the sunglasses with limited photos on a busy background, I decided to test the software on a blank surface with 100+ photos instead. This proved to have a much better outcome, although
                        I plan on experimenting to see whether taking a large number of photos on a more texture-filled background would produce even better results. The sunglasses in the scan still have issues, except I believe that 
                        it would be possible to print them after some refining.

                       After many attempts and restarts of the ideas mentioned at the top, I knew that I just needed to create something completely
                       basic in order to be able to approach something more complex later. I knew that I wanted to make something that either moved
                       or could be easily pieced together with another object. I settled on the idea of making a little jar that could hold earrings or contains with a lid that 
                       could be screwed onto it to close it. I also thought that I could add a design that acted as a handle at the top of the lid as well. 
                       <br><br>
                        I started by creating a cylinder that would act as the base of the jar. I wanted to start small so that I could print something tiny before making it more like the size of a normal jar.
                        I then worked on creating a lid. Instead of having the lid seal over the top of the base, I used the threading tool in Fusion to be able to "screw in" the lid to the base. Then, I created a handle on the top,
                        which I originally designed as a flower (although it doesn't quite look like one). I then added supports in PrusaSlicer and printed each body separately at the same time.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>error alert:</strong> the jar didn't turn out the way that I wanted it to. In particular, I believe that it is a bit too simple and the flower definitely could be made to look 
                        much more aesthetically pleasing. However, I ran into a larger issue. I first printed an incredibly tiny version, which was able to properly screw together with minimal issue, yet the 
                        larger version that I created is difficult (if not impossible) to screw together. Due to the large number of supports that were necessary for the design, some of the supports appear to be stuck 
                        within the threading, which makes it challenging to put together. The force that would be necessary to put the two pieces together would also break the handle that I've created, which I've overall realized 
                        is far too fragile. For these reasons, this is definitely only an initial version that I will continue to improve upon (and will likely start over with).
                        <br><br>
                        As an aside, I also tested out printing some open source designs, such as the adorable cat phone holder featured in the photos below. I plan on looking into more open source modeling to see how 
                        people approach common issues such as structuring the location of supports to be easily removable.
