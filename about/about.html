                    <h2>Hello, world! <br> I'm Kamryn (or Kammy)!</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am currently a senior in Quincy House 
                        studying Computer Science with a secondary in Educational Studies. 
                        I'm from Sandusky, Ohio - Home of Cedar Point (pictures below)!
                        I'm incredibly passionate about using computer science & coding to help others, and to 
                        specifically help in educational settings. I started coding when I was 13 after being offered an opportunity
                        to attend a <a href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/">Kode With Klossy</a> summer camp. It was a truly life-changing experience, and I fell
                        in love with computer science during it. I've always loved solving puzzles, and I was üé∂ <a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXcjPySjdJU">so obsessed</a> üé∂ with the idea of being able to create
                        helpful or fun applications that could be in the pockets & hands of people around the world! 
                        In particular, I adore coding in Swift and working in iOS development. I started working as a CS50 Teaching Fellow during my sophomore Fall semester to hopefully help students
                        fall in love with CS like I did, and I've also continued teaching & staying in touch with the Kode With Klossy community since 2016.
                        <br><br> 
                        I am also pursuing a citation in French here at Harvard! I started learning French in 1st grade
                        after one of my friends asked if we could race to see who could become fluent first on Duolingo..... I 
                        think she may have forfeited the challenge a while ago....
                        Speaking of Duolingo (see below), I have also worked in designing and creating media, primarily around computer science educational intiatives.
                        At the moment, I am super excited to be a Co-Director of Marketing & Strategy for WECode @ Harvard, the world's largest undergraduate run women in STEM conference. 
                        If you are interested in volunteering at it or attending, please chat with me! It is happening on February 22-23 of this year! üéä </p>
                        Outside of school, I love to hike, bake anything with sugar, and to make coffee! ‚òïÔ∏è
